      <h1>Component : ðŸ§©</h1>
      <p> Components are the building blocks of a {x} app. </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Tey allow us to make all the visible part of our website / App like,
        buttons , searchbar , form , headers , footers , navbar , or even entire
        page. which , and the actuall key is each component can be used anywhere
        any number of times, see it like you wrote a piece of JSX code in a file
        , now u can use it wherever required , Sounds cool haah... and its cool
        , now imaging a giant project like amazon website lots of differnet
        pages lots of different compinents , humongous amount of navigation ,
        and many more stuff , to be written more over here ,
      </p>
      <p>components make code reusabilty more efficient.</p>
